# src/assets

Design imagery, icons, and multimedia used across the site are stored here. Assets are imported with Viteâ€™s module resolution helper (`@/assets/...`).

## Conventions

- Optimise images before committing (use appropriate formats such as `.webp` for photography).
- Place certification badges and partner logos in this folder so they can be shared by multiple pages.
- Large media such as hero videos live here as well; consider providing fallbacks or poster frames.

### Notable assets
